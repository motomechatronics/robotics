How to manage ROS workspaces in your local computer.
The catkin_ws directory is known as the catkin workspace or ROS workspace, and it is basically the place where you will have to place all the new ROS packages that you create. 
Follow how do you create one of these workspaces.

Create a ROS catkion workspace
First of all, let's create the folder where we will create our ROS workspace.

mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ..
catkin_make
go to catkin_ws
so

To make sure your workspace is properly overlayed by the setup script, you can check the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable with the following command.

echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

If everything goes fine, you should get the following:

user:~/catkin_ws$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/home/user/catkin_ws/src:/home/user/catkin_ws/src:... others workaspace

As you can see, your catkin workspace is now on top of the catkin_ws.
To create others workspace, repeat the instructions. Take care to create the new directory at the same level of catkin_ws.

it is possible write the bashrc file as:

sudo nano ~/.bashrc

add at the end

source /home/ubuntu/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
